            Accessibility Statement</h2>
        This is the official accessibility statement for KrazyGames. If you have any questions
        or comments, feel free to contact us using the <a href="/Home/ContactUs.aspx">Contact form</a>
        <h4>
            Standards compliance</h4>
        All pages on this site are WCAGA approved, complying with all priority 1 rules of
        the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. This is a judgment call; many guidelines
        are intentionally vague and can not be tested automatically.We have reviewed all
        the guidelines and believe that all pages are in compliance.
        <br />
        Most pages/areas also conform to the WCAGAA rules, although the work to attain full
        AA status is ongoing.
        <br />
        All pages on this site validate as XHTML 1.0 Transitional . For example, check the
        home page for XHTML validity.
        <br />
        All pages on this site validate as well formed CSS . For example, check the site
        for CSS validity.
        <h4>
            Links</h4>
        Many links have title attributes which describe the link in greater detail, unless
        the text of the link already fully describes the target (such as the headline of
        an article).
        <br />
        Links are written to make sense out of context.
        <h4>
            Images</h4>
        All content images used in this site include descriptive ALT attributes. Purely
        decorative graphics include null ALT attributes.
        <br />
        All images are optimised for fast download times and modem browsing.
        <h4>
            Visual design</h4>
        This site uses cascading style sheets for visual layout.
        <br />
        This site uses only relative font sizes, compatible with the user-specified "text
        size" option in visual browsers.
        <br />
        If your browser or browsing device does not support style sheets at all, the content
        of each page is still readable.
        <h4>
            Browser Support</h4>
        We designed to support the following browsers specifically, as well as all standards-compliant
        browsers.
        <ul>
            <li>Internet Explorer 6 for Windows</li>
            <li>Mozilla Firefox for Windows</li>
            <li>Netscape 8 for Windows</li>
            <li>Opera 8 for Windows</li>
            <li>Mozilla Firefox for Macintosh</li>
            <li>Safari for Macintosh</li>
        </ul>
        The site is also currently being tested with the LYNX text browser and the JAWS
        screen reader.
