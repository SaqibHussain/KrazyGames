        <h3>
            In the beginning...</h3>
        KrazyGames.com may now be one of the UK's largest online electronics retailers,
        but it wasn't always like this. The original Krazy Games group (before we added
        the .com) was founded in 1987 by two enterprising young men, and friends: entrepreneur
        David Atherton (DA) and writer Bruce Smith (BS). Together, Dave and Bruce launched
        Krazy Games Press, a publisher of technology books specialising in 'how to' guides
        for an increasingly technology-focussed world. Three years later, despite an enduring
        friendship, the two went their separate ways, leaving David in 100% control of Krazy
        Games.
        <br />
        <br />
        From starting out helping people understand technology, David saw it as a natural
        progression to start selling the technology itself, and it was only a matter of
        time before Krazy Games Direct was established. Launched in 1990, Krazy Games Direct
        was the offline (ah, remember mail order?) predecessor to the online enterprise
        you know and love today.

            <h3>
                ...It's Getting Better All The Time...</h3>
        </center>
        The IT and Technology world has progressed in astounding leaps and bounds over the
        past twenty years and, having started the company in 1990 with the faintest rumblings
        of the great Silicon Valley revolution on the horizon, Krazy Games had to continuously
        adapt to growing demand and never-ending technological advances. However, with the
        evolving technology, Krazy Games was provided with new ways to provide excellent
        customer service and the latest products at competitive prices. It is testament
        to the Kraz yGames' management team that they were able to take us across from the
        realm of the real to the online world, to leave behind the postal orders and start
        our journey on the internet superhighway.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unsurprisingly, our prowess and reputation brought us unprecedented attention and
        so, in April 2006, David sold the Krazy Games Group. It was a sad day for us all,
        having said goodbye to BS we no longer had the DA. However, luckily, we got BT,
        and as of April 28th 2006,KrazyGames came under control of British Telecom, now
        providers of one of the UK's fastest broadband and highest quality television services.
        This transition marked the start of many exciting developments in the Krazy Games'
        saga.

        <h3>
            ...Today</h3>
        Krazy Games.com has now collected a multitude of high profile awards over the years
        for both its outstanding online retailing, as well as its exemplary overall business
        performance. Some of the awards that we're most proud of include the "What Laptop!",
        "PC Pro" and "Computeractive" magazine awards for "Best Online Retailer", as well
        as always appearing on Hitwise's Top 10 website awards, awarded to those with the
        largest online presences (this year we beat overclockers.co.uk and misco. Get us!).
        <br />
        <br />
        We know the internet's fairly old now, and most people who grew up with it know
        the difference between safe and unsafe internet shopping, but just to be on the
        safe (better than sorry) side we let you know on every page our commitment to secure
        internet commerce.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Serving the whole of the UK from our state-of-the-art office near Bolton (Westhoughton
        if you must know), Krazy Games employ over 300 people all committed to providing
        you, our customer, with the best possible service. And seeing as there are over
        a million visits per month, with 4000 of you liking our Facebook pages and following
        our tweets, as well as 90% of you recommending our humble website to your friends,
        we certainly think we're doing something right (and we're not about to stop now).
