    <h2>
        Our Privacy Policy</h2>
    This policy covers all users who register to use the dabs.com website. It is not
    necessary to register in order to gain access to the searching facilities of the
    site, but we may restrict access to certain areas as referred to in Principle 2
    below. Access to dabs.com is free of charge to all users. The dabs.com website is
    operated by dabs.com PLC. We are committed to protecting your privacy when you are
    using our online services. To protect your privacy, we apply five principles which
    you can read about below.
    <h4>
        Principle 1 - Notice</h4>
    During our registration process, we ask for personal information which both identifies
    you and enables us to communicate with you. We also invite you to tell us your interests
    so that we can make our communications relevant and interesting for you.
    <br />
    To help us prevent fraud, please be aware that we may make searches about you at
    credit reference agencies for the purpose of verifying your identity. These agencies
    will supply us with information, including information from the Electoral Register.
    The fact that we have requested an identity check is recorded by these agencies,
    though be assured that the searches will not be seen, or used by lenders to assess
    your ability to obtain credit.
    <br />
    Please also note that we may cross reference the information you provide us with
    data from a specialist anti-fraud third party with a view to stopping fraudulent
    transactions before they occur.
    <br />
    We will use the information you provide only for the following purposes:
    <ul>
        <li>To send updates regarding the status of your orders</li>
        <li>To send you newsletters and details of offers and promotions in which we believe
            you will be interested</li>
        <li>To improve the content, design and layout of the dabs.com website and to facilitate
            knowledge management</li>
        <li>To understand the interests and buying behaviour of our registered users</li>
        <li>To perform other such general marketing and promotional activities focused on our
            products and services. We may also register you for our other services which we
            feel may be useful or of interest to you.</li>
        <li>Very occasionally, dabs.com may share your details with carefully selected third
            parties for general marketing and promotional activities. However, if your communication
            preferences show that you have chosen NOT to receive such information from third
            parties, then of course your details will not be shared. You can edit your communications
            preferences at any time via the 'my account' section of our website.</li>
        <li>We sometimes use other companies to provide services to you or to provide services
            to us. To enable them to do this, we may need to share your personal information
            with them. When we do so, these companies are required to act in accordance with
            the instructions we give them and they must meet the requirements of the Data Protection
            Act to keep information secure.</li>
    </ul>
    This privacy policy only covers the dabs.com website at KrazyGames.com. Other links
    within this site to other websites or framed third party sites within dabs.com are
    not covered by this policy. We may continue to use your personal information for
    a period after you cease being a registered user.
    <h4>
        Principle 2 - Consent and Choice</h4>
    If you choose not to register or not provide personal information, you may still
    visit the dabs.com website but you will not be able to access the restricted areas
    available to registered users. By completing the registration process, you are confirming
    that you accept the terms of our Privacy Policy as described and consent to our
    using your information accordingly.
    <h4>
        Principle 3 - Access</h4>
    We have provided an administration service (your account) where you can review your
    personal information at any time to ensure it is correct and current. You will be
    able to update, correct, change or delete inaccurate details. You may also change
    your choice of opting in or out of marketing and promotional activities, although
    you may continue to receive mailings for a short period while your change is being
    processed. You have the right to ask for a copy of your personal information on
    payment of a small fee.
    <h4>
        Principle 4 - Security</h4>
    We have taken appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information is not
    unlawfully processed. dabs.com uses industry standard practices to safeguard the
    confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, including "firewalls"
    and Secure Socket Layers. dabs.com treats data as an asset that must be protected
    against loss and unauthorized access. However, no information transferred over the
    Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We employ
    many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorised access
    by users inside and outside the company.
    <br />
    We will not be transferring your personal information outside of the European Economic
    Area unless otherwise specifically advised.
    <h4>
        Principle 4.1 - Cookies</h4>
    Our website creates multiple cookies on your machine which contain session and state
    information. The information within these cookies does not include any personal
    or financial information. Our website requires cookies to be enabled in the web
    browser and in any third party security programs to allow tasks such as registering,
    logging in, buying items or accessing accounts. Please be aware that should cookies
    be disabled or blocked by third party software, many of our website's features will
    be impaired or unavailable.
    <br />
    Third party Internet sites that you can link to from our website are not covered
    by our privacy policy, so we urge you to be careful when you enter any personal
    information online. dabs.com accepts no responsibility or liability for these sites.
    Other companies which advertise or offer their products or services on our website
    may also allocate cookies to your PC. The types of cookies they use and how they
    use the information generated by them will be governed by their own privacy policies
    and not ours.
    <h4>
        Principle 5 - Minors</h4>
    The dabs.com website is not intended for children and we ask that no-one under the
    age of 12 submits personal information to us or uses the site without supervision
    of a parent or guardian.
    <h4>
        Principle 6 - Deletion of your Personal Data </h4>
        
        We are unable to delete your dabs.com
        account information containing your personal information for a period of 6 years
        from the date of your last interaction with us (this could be a sales transaction,
        a return, or some other interaction with dabs.com via our Customer Services team
        or our online tools). This is because we may need to access historical information
        for business reporting purposes. Please note however, that at any point in time
        you may opt in or out of marketing communications via the 'your account' section
        of this website.
