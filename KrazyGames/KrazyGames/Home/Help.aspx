        <h4>
            Product Availability and Despatch Times
        </h4>
        Availability of a product is based on the following criteria which is indicated
        to you at the checkout confirmation stage of a transaction. If a product is not
        available to purchase or order, the buy button will not allow you to add the item
        to your shopping basket.
        <h4>
            Immediate</h4>
        This means that the item is in stock in our distribution centre and can be despatched
        to you right away via your chosen method of shipping. So, for example, Royal Mail
        First Class deliveries ought to be made within 2-3 days of placing your order.
        <h4>
            Despatched in 2-3 Working Days
        </h4>
        This means that the item will take 2-3 days to leave our distribution centre, after
        which the normal delivery timelines apply. So, for example, Royal Mail First Class
        deliveries ought to be made within 5-7 days of placing your order.
        <h4>
            Out of Stock
        </h4>
        The product is not currently available and we are unable to confirm when/if we will
        obtain further supplies at the present time.
        <h4>
            Preorder
        </h4>
        We will ship your preordered item to you prior to release (subject to availability)
        via your chosen method of shipping. The vast majority of preorders arrive for the
        day of release. However we cannot guarantee delivery by release date for standard
        Royal Mail deliveries, because Royal Mail cannot make this guarantee. Choose Special
        Delivery to ensure it is delivered for the release date. Please note that International
        orders will take longer to be delivered. Please note that release dates are subject
        to change.
        <h4>
            NB</h4>
        Please note that all of our orders, including orders for download products, are
        subject to authorisation checks by our accounts team before being processed. This
        may therefore delay the despatch of your order or sending of your download code
        until the next working day.
